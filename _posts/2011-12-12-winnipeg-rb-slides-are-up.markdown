Recently I did a talk at the December 2011 [Winnipeg.rb User Group](http://winnipegrb.org/) meeting. I've put up the [slides](http://prezi.com/h-ucm2ifx6fs/winnipegrb-typhoeus-demo/) on Prezi and the [demo](https://github.com/Nitrodist/Winnipeg.rb-Typhoeus-Demo) on Github.

For those who weren't there, the talk was on [Typhoeus](https://github.com/typhoeus/typhoeus) (edit: new github repo location), an awesome library for running and processing HTTP requests in parallel.
