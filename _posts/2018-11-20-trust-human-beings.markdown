title: "You Need to Trust Human Beings, You Idiot"
---

I mean this title in the most lovingly way possible, but people are idiots. You, however, are also an idiot, but don't close this article just yet! It's very, very important that you finish this article and consider the implications of the points that are raised.

You need to read everything in this article.

Are you skimming and skipping ahead? **Hey jackass,** _you_ need to read everything! I promise this won't take more than 15 minutes of your life and it will shape the way you think about a huge array of subjects from your job, to your family, to your community, to your government, etc..

I'm serious, you absolutely need to read everything. Me writing this down and communicating it to you is a central point of this article, as you will understand later. If you can't finish reading one article from start to finish, how are we going to expect the rest the human beings that we depend on to make accurate decisions?

Is it too old-timey to write an overview first and then delve into each subject? Probably, but it's pretty **god damn important** that we have a structure to this damn article. Hell, I could just write and write about this, but you, the human being, deserve your information to be presented well and concretely so that we as a species can make decisions properly.

# The tenets of human society

Hear me out. We're going to try to understand and reason about how human beings behave and interact in a society. It's weird to think about it on some level â€” after all, that's all there is to life for the most part. If you think about your life, almost every single aspect of it is affected by somebody else. We live such that almost every single waking moment of our lives has been affected in some form by other human beings. A huge, huge amount of work has been done by people who are alive now and those that have come before us. A ton of it is just technology, but it is that technology that, when used by other human beings, benefits you either directly or indirectly.

[108 billion](https://www.prb.org/howmanypeoplehaveeverlivedonearth/) is the number of people that have existed. 7 billion are alive today. That's a ton of work being done. That's a ton of technology that has been created in the past and passed on to the future. The amount of effort that has gone into creating this damn computer that I'm writing this on is incredible when you think about it. From harvesting metals, to plastic production, to computer programming, to the Internet, to fibre optic technology, to LEDs, the list keeps going. The only way I can and could have benefited from this is from other human beings doing a ton of work in figuring out every little part of this machine.

If there was a metric for human-hours of effort put into designing and developing everything that has to do with a piece of technlogy, I'd love to see some analyses. I'm talking about the person who developed the aluminimum milling techniques, the person who developed the aluminum mining techniques, the person who developed the keyboard, the person who designed the backlit keyboard, and so forth. It's truly mind-bogglingly large the amount of human-hours put into any piece of technology and all of their predecessors.

Anyway, let's start off with some tenets. This article is a grand-unification theory of sorts, so it's hard to summarize. That said, I will explain at length on each subject so that you're satisfied.
