Working from home gives you the freedom to get a lot done, away from the distractions of office life. On the other hand, it also gives the freedom to goof off all day! 

I've worked remotely with 8+ colleagues for over a year at [Wave](https://www.waveapps.com/) and with [Nathan Bertram](http://trueperspective.net/) on [ArrangeMySeat](https://arrangemyseat.com) for even longer. Here's some of the knowledge I've gleamed from that experience.

## Setting Limits

One of the problems of working from home is that the separation between work and home doesn't exist so you may find yourself spending more or less time than you should on work. Because of this setting limits is *paramount*.

The idea behind setting limits is that you're in a profession. Spending time outside of your obligation on work should be done with caution as you have duty to respect your own time and sanity. 

On the flip side for your employer, they should also be concerned if you're working more than agreed on. If you're already working 50-60 hours a week on work, then you're at risk for burning yourself out. 

Also, when you invariably need to pull some overtime to get something done ASAP, where's that time going to come from? Suddenly, working 50-60 hours that week isn't enough and you're spending most of your waking hours at work to get something done. **Respect yourself and your profession by setting limits**.

To know what the limits should be, you need to follow a few guidelines:

1. Work the same hours as your team
2. Work during an period that overlaps with your team if #1 fails

That's it! I wouldn't recommend working off-hours as the turn-around time to get issues resolved suddenly turns from a few minutes to 8+ hours (whenever your team is online). If you're developing solo, do the development work when your stakeholders in the project are available.

## Timeboxing

[Timeboxing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeboxing) is allotting a fixed amount of time for a certain task.  I love this technique because it protects against two things:

1. Perfectionism
2. Procrastination

There is **perfectionism** that is [rampant within programming](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1196405/how-to-keep-yourself-from-perfectionism-when-coding) that probably affects yourself. Having a maximum limit of time to do something (or to try to do something) will limit you in your quest to produce The Perfect Codeâ„¢. Remember, any problem can become a time suck.

As to the **procrastination**, it is also [a hot topic](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2009/03/procrastination-and-the-bikeshed-effect.html) within the programming community. Having a set task to do actually *accomplish* something gives yourself the accountability to commit (pun intended) and do it.

Now, specifically, there are *many* timeboxing techniques out there. One of the most popular and famous techniques out there is the [Pomodoro Technique](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) which advocates 25 minutes blocks interspaced with varying amounts of breaks. If you're having trouble switching between tasks and need a lot of structure, then this technique may be for you.

Personally, I prefer allotting a task or a set of tasks in 1 hour slots because that it's not too short of an amount of time that I'll constantly exceed the task I'm working on and not too long of a time such that I get stuck wasting my time trying to figure out a problem. If I'm not done after an hour then I can ask myself questions like:

* Am I doing this right?
* What's left to do?
* Why is it taking so long?
* Can I ask someone for help?

With the timeboxing technique, you're forced to consider these questions instead of blindly ignore them for the day. Having someone in-person to ask a question (or be interrupted by) is a luxury of the office and pausing to ask these questions and interact with people is extremely useful while working from home.

Everyone has a timeboxing technique that works for them -- go out there and find it!

## Communication

This may come as a surprise to you, but [communication is one of the most important skills to have as a programmer](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2011/02/how-to-write-without-writing.html).
