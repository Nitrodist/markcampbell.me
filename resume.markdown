## Experience

<p>
<strong>Senior Software Developer</strong>
<br>
<em>theScore / Penn Interactive,</em> Winnipeg, Canada
<br>
June 2024 - Current
</p>

- My main responsibility was to maintain and develop GraphQL, gRPC, and Web
  Views APIs powered by a Phoenix app processing 10,000 to 30,000 withdrawals and
  deposits a day at the virtual casino ESPN BET / theScore BET / Hollywood Casino
  / theScore Casino, handling millions of dollars
- Built and maintained APIs backend APIs and full-stack integrations on web,
  Android, and iOS for various payment provider vendors such as
  PaySafe, Venmo, Paramount Commerce, PayPal, and more
- One of my first major projects was to design and integrate a new app, Hollywood Casino, into the Payments service at theScore - I wrote tech specs, tickets, and then followed it up by implementing it with the team for a seamless launch of a brand new property at Penn Interactive
- Built new and maintained existing DataDog monitors, logging, and traces for monitoring deposits and withdrawls in the Payments ecosystem which included monitoring of internal services and external payment providers
- Launched several new states and provinces for support in the apps at Penn Interactive i.e. Washington DC, Maryland, etc. were new states that are now supported in the apps
- Implemented fixes for, redacted, and identified Personally Identifiable Information (PII) leaking into external service providers like BugSnag and DataDog
- On-call engineer maintaining said APIs during the busiest of times like Superbowl and March Madness
- Supported and oversaw the no-downtime migration of the Payments service's
  Kubernetes namespace from A to B as well as the migration from a major
  subdomain change
- Redesigned and implemented complex background job processing logic using Oban

<p>
<strong>Co-founder</strong>
<br>
<em>BusyPaws,</em> Winnipeg, Canada
<br>
September 2022 - May 2024
</p>

- I have developed many full features for BusyPaws including major features like the calendar, time sheets, group bookings, additional user types, and more. I improved many existing features and fixed many bugs in our Ruby on Rails + JS stack.
- To name a few of the tools I used, webpacker, turbolinks, momentjs, jQuery, Font Awesome, flatpickr, Bootstrap, Searchkick, Sidekiq (Redis), ActiveJob, Quickbooks, Mailchimp, NewRelic, imgproxy, Slim templating, Honeybadger, and Capybara/cuprite/selenium
- One of my projects at BusyPaws was to build and implement the BusyPaws mobile app for Android and iOS. I developed the mobile app for Android+iOS using Flutter. Along the way I integrated our existing Ruby on Rails app's web experience into the mobile device platforms. With key features like native offline SMS and Email messaging experience and push notifications, this delivers a lot of value for our customers .
- Other major features I worked on related to the mobile app Firebase Cloud Messaging (push notifications), error reporting, rich text editors in Flutter, Flutter Riverpod, Flutter Go Router, and server side driven configuration. As a full stack developer, I implemented all of the server side changes as well and used my prior experience creating and maintaining JSON and GraphQL APIs at theScore.
- One of my roles at BusyPaws has been to carry out devops oriented tasks - we work in a AWS and a Heroku environment for our Rails 7 app with CircleCI carrying out builds. I debug and design daily in these environments to solve our business's problems concerning email, scaling services, and much more. I have worked extensively in our CircleCI environment to improve their reliability, to reduce false run fails, and to speed up the build times - I have done this as well in the past at theScore in addition to Jenkins experience while there.

<p>
<strong>Senior Software Developer and acting Team Lead</strong>
<br>
<em>theScore,</em> Toronto, Canada
<br>
March 2020 - September 2022
</p>

- While at theScore from 2020 to 2022, I developed and maintained public facing APIs (millions of users), internal APIs, and did full-stack software development for internal facing systems. All of this work was a mix of Ruby on Rails, Elixir, and Devops tasks.
- One of my major projects at the time was to migrate major systems from AWS EC2 to AWS EKS (Kubernetes) without any downtime. A proud achievement of mine was directing and managing my team to ensure a problem-free transition for the largest public facing API at theScore. This was done for many Ruby on Rails based applications. A comprehensive checklist was created by myself that was used for each of the systems that we were migrating over.
- I documented a lot of code and systems while at theScore - I used my years of experience to produce documentation throughout the code bases, the wikis, and more, but most interestingly I created and produced a video based on a presentation I gave to the other software developers at theScore.
- I worked in Elixir a lot during my time there. I worked on two major projects: a data processing system for XML / JSON with polling and the largest public facing GraphQL API servicing tens of thousands devices concurrently with the absinthe library, including deduplicating requests across the cluster.
- I worked in Ruby on Rails in my time at theScore from 2020 to 2022. Among many projects and bugs, I created a robust ‘spreadsheet’ functionality in Ruby on Rails and other open source tools which an internal team uses as the data provider for one of the leagues at theScore.
- I mentored and managed many software developer at theScore as my role as the stand-in tech lead for my team. Many co-op students were hired and interviewed under me.
- I worked as the release engineer for our team - I approved of our releases for dozens of systems and was responsible for deploying them.
- I built and maintained alerting and monitoring infrastructure with Splunk and Datadog
