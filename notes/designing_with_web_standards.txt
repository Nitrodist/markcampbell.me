Stop trying to get ie6 to work with the new design of a site and instead just focus on ie6 actually just being readable for those users -- less hacks!

Stop versioning sites specifically for each browser, i.e., stop detecting version and serving different site.

Those who do not respect a tool are unlikely to use it correctly.

Books goes on about  bandwidth savings -- is it really relevant in this day and age? The 'it gets rendered faster' argument is a better argument.

mod_gzip apache module exists for gzipping content.

Top Reason Not to Use XHTML 1
  1. You don't know the rules of XHTML

Some optional reading material
  Ambient Findability: What We Find Changes Who We become by Peter Morville (O'Reilly, 2005)
  Building Findable Websites: Web Standards, SEO, and Beyond by Aarron Walter (New Riders, 2008)

onMouseOver attribute must be onmouseover ;)

The W3C validator flags the missing space error with the user-friendly, clear-as-day message, "XML Parsing Error: attributes construct error." And they wonder why the kids are on pot.

Content-type meta tag is a sure-fire way of setting the character encoding for the document (or we could use the content-type http header) BECAUSE OF IE we can't use the xml prolog.

trick ie6 and ie7 into supporting html5 http://slidshare.net/remy.sharp/html5-js-apis

MIME type of text/html is html5 - MIME type of application/xhtml+xml will be xhtml5

You can do document.idname instead of document.getElementsById()  - they recommend the latter. Why?

Repetition is the mother of learning.

font-size-adjust css property to adjust x-height - www.brighterplanet.com for an example

@font-face css thing embeds real fonts in the page

sIFR http://wiki.novemberborn.net/sifr3

CSS Box Model: Margin - Border - Padding - Content

Vertically adjacent elements collapse into each other's vertical margins.
  * demo: http://www.andybudd.com/archives/2003/11/no_margin_for_error

text-indent property for paragraphs. Kind of like real paragraphs indenting the first line.

display property values: http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#display-prop

float reduces the width to match the width of the elements that it contains.

css3-grid can be used instead of floats http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-grid

The clear property accepts four values: none, left, right and both. Clear tells the browser to position that element beneath floated elements depending on the value that clear is passed.

http://www.positionisevertyhing.net/explorer/doubled-margin.html
  * If box is floated left (or right) and there is left-margin (or right if floated right), then the margin is doubled.
  * add display:inline to box to fix

Limit yourself to two or three fonts on a website to avoid the 'classified ads' effect

Readable measure is important -- the number of characters per line of text. 
  45-75 characters is appropriate for a single column of text with a serif face.
  40-50 characters for multiple columns on a grid.
